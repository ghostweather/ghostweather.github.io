# Heller Final Proposal LMSC 261

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Existential Music Video (VR)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is a music video designed for virtual reality.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

Aframe.io, Ableton Live, ChatGPT (most likely), glitch.com, Stack Overflow

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want to see what I am able to do in aframe before committing hard to any one thing, but I am creating a track with nostalgic 8-bit sounding synths and vocals for the purpose of a VR music video.  I will attempt to set this video in space, with the "player" suspended with nothing below their feet.  I'm hoping to create asteroids and space junk moving around.  I want to stick with this theme, but If that turns out to be too difficult, I will adjust as I go until I find something that is doable but still challenging. I plan to execute it through aframe, and while I do not currently have a VR headset, I am able to view the VR on a web browser or phone.  I am still figuring that out but it looks like there is a site called glitch.com which can also hlep with viewing the VR experience on the computer without a headset.

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

No.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I want to have created a 3D VR space that coincides with music.  Even if it isn't pretty or doesn't execute perfectly, I want to at least have a space where I've created a world in VR that implements both music and visuals together.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a successful video that executes properly and is enjoyable in the VR space, with music synced to the video in a satisfying way.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a VR video that is fully finished and releasable.  My best friend back home is a huge VR fan, and I'd love to be able to create a peice of art that I can send him to view on his headset.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
